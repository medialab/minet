        You must set your account language to English (US) for the
        command to work.

        Note that, by default, Facebook will translate post text
        when they are not written in a language whitelisted here:
        https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=language

        In this case, minet will output both the original text and
        the translated one. But be aware that original text may be
        truncated, so you might want to edit your Facebook settings
        using the url above to make sure text won't be translated
        for posts you are interested in.

        Of course, the CLI will warn you when translated text is
        found so you can choose to edit your settings early as
        as possible.

        Finally, some post text is always truncated on Facebook
        when displayed in lists. This text is not yet entirely
        scraped by minet at this time.

        Retrieve the approximate number of "likes" (actually an aggregated engagement metric)
        that a url got on Facebook. The command can also be used with a list of urls stored in a CSV file.
        This number is found by scraping Facebook's share button, which only gives a
        rough estimation of the real engagement metric: "Share 45K" for example.

        Note that this number does not actually only correspond to the number of
        likes or shares, but it is rather the sum of like, love, ahah, angry, etc.
        reactions plus the number of comments and shares that the URL got on Facebook
        (here is the official documentation: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/faqs
