        This requires to be logged in to an Tiktok account, so
        by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
        authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

        If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
        to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
        -c/--cookie flag.

        Challenges are hashtags, that can be associated with a description.

        The url have a limited life time (indicated by a timestamp in the
        url). If you want to get the resources associated to it, you should
        use the `minet fetch` command.

        This command allows you to get about 450 results, ordered by user
        relevance (a mix of most popular, and most relevant according to your
        profile).
