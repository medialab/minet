## -h/--help

If you need help about a command, don't hesitate to use the `-h/--help` flag or the `help` command:

```
minet ct posts -h
# or:
minet ct posts --help
# or
minet help ct posts
```

## --version

To check the installed version of `minet`, you can use the `--version` flag:

```
minet --version
>>> minet x.x.x
```

## minetrc config files

Minet supports configuration files so you can skip some tedious command line arguments that you would need to provide each time you call `minet` otherwise (such as `--key` for `youtube` commands).

Those configuration files can be written in YAML or JSON and can either be passed to minet using the `--rcfile` argument or will be searched at the following paths (with this precedence):

- `./.minetrc{,.yml,.yaml,.json}`
- `~/.minetrc{,.yml,.yaml,.json}`

_Configuration file_

```yml
---
facebook:
  cookie: "MY_FACEBOOK_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet fb` commands
instagram:
  cookie: "MY_INSTAGRAM_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet insta` commands
mediacloud:
  token: "MY_MC_TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet mc` commands
tiktok:
  cookie: "MY_TIKTOK_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet tk` commands
twitter:
  cookie: "MY_TWITTER_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet tw scrape` command
  api_key: "MY_API_KEY" # Used as --api-key for `minet tw` commands
  api_secret_key: "MY_API_SECRET_KEY" # Used as --api-secret-key for `minet tw` commands
  access_token: "MY_ACCESS_TOKEN" # Used as --access-token for `minet tw` commands
  access_token_secret: "MY_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" # Used as --access-token-secret for `minet tw` commands
youtube:
  key: "MY_YT_API_KEY" # Used as --key for `minet yt` commands
```

## minet environment variables

Alternatively you can also set some arguments using environment variables whose name starts with `MINET_` and followed by the proper key.

To build the name of the variable, first check what can be configured in a minet [rcfile](#minetrc-config-files) and build your variable name by joining its path using an underscore:

For instance, to override `facebook.cookie`, the variable will be `MINET_FACEBOOK_COOKIE`.

If one of the path's key already contains underscore, it will work all the same. So to override `twitter.api_key`, the variable will be `MINET_TWITTER_API_KEY`.

Note that the given variable will be cast to the proper type as if it was passed as a command line argument.

Finally note that command line arguments and flags will take precedence over environment variables, and that environment variables will take precedence over any rcfile configuration, but you can of course mix and match.

## cookies

```
Usage: minet cookies [-h] [--silent] [--refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND]
                     [--simple-progress] [--csv] [--url URL] [-o OUTPUT]

                                Name of the browser from which to grab cookies.

Options:
  --csv                         Whether to format the output as CSV. If --url is
                                set, will output the cookie's morsels as CSV.
  --url URL                     If given, only returns full cookie header value
                                for this url.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be

  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

Examples:

. Dumping cookie jar from firefox:
    $ minet cookies firefox > jar.txt

  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Using the most basic crawler following HTML links:
    $ minet crawl url -i urls.csv --max-depth 1

. Crawling using the `process` function from the `crawl` module:
    $ minet crawl -m crawl:process -O crawl-data

Notes regarding sqlite storage temporary files:

If you spawn a persistent crawler, some of its state will be kept using
specialized sqlite databases on disk.

Be aware that sqlite sometimes need to perform cleanup operations that rely
on temporary files that will be written in a folder configured as the
`SQLITE_TMPDIR` env variable. Be sure to set this variable when running this
command, especially when the crawler files will be stored on a different disk
and if writing in the host's `/tmp` directory can be risky due to insufficient
storage available.

# Minet Focus Crawl Command

Minet crawl feature with the possibility
to use regular expressions to filter content.

Regex are not case sensitive, but
accents sensitive.

Regex must be written between simple quotes.

Positional Arguments:
  url_or_url_column             Single start url to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing start urls when using
                                -i/--input. Defaults to "url".

Options:

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Running a simple crawler:
    $ minet focus-crawl url -i urls.csv --content-filter '(?:assembl[ée]e nationale|s[ée]nat)' -O ./result

Notes regarding sqlite storage temporary files:

If you spawn a persistent crawler, some of its state will be kept using
specialized sqlite databases on disk.

Be aware that sqlite sometimes need to perform cleanup operations that rely
on temporary files that will be written in a folder configured as the
`SQLITE_TMPDIR` env variable. Be sure to set this variable when running this
command, especially when the crawler files will be stored on a different disk
and if writing in the host's `/tmp` directory can be risky due to insufficient
storage available.

# Minet Fetch Command

Use multiple threads to fetch batches of urls from a CSV file. The
command outputs a CSV report with additional metadata about the
HTTP calls and will generally write the retrieved files in a folder
given by the user.

Positional Arguments:
  url_or_url_column             Single url to process or name of the CSV column
                                containing urls when using -i/--input.

Options:
  -z, --compress-on-disk        Whether to compress the contents.
  --compress-transfer           Whether to send a "Accept-Encoding" header
                                asking for a compressed response. Usually better
                                for bandwidth but at the cost of more CPU work.
  -c, --contents-in-report      Whether to include retrieved contents, e.g.
                                html, directly in the report and avoid writing
                                them in a separate folder. This requires to
                                standardize encoding and won't work on binary
                                formats.
  --domain-parallelism DOMAIN_PARALLELISM
                                Max number of urls per domain to hit at the same

                                the provided file names have no extension (e.g.
                                ".jpg", ".pdf", etc.) the correct extension will
                                be added depending on the file type.

                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --resume                      "Whether to resume from an aborted collection.
                                Need -o to be set.
  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

Columns being added to the output:

. "original_index": index of the line in the original file (the output will be
    arbitrarily ordered since multiple requests are performed concurrently).
. "resolved_url": final resolved url (after templating & solving redirects).
. "http_status": HTTP status code of the request, e.g. 200, 404, 503 etc.
. "datetime_utc": datetime when the response was finished.
. "fetch_error": an error code if anything went wrong when performing the request.
. "path": path to the downloaded file, relative to the folder given
    through -O/--output-dir.
. "mimetype": detected mimetype of the requested file.
. "encoding": detected encoding of the requested file if relevant.
. "body_size": size of the downloaded document in bytes.
. "body": if -c/--contents-in-report is set, will contain the
    downloaded text and the files won't be written to disk.

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Fetching a single url (can be useful when piping):
    $ minet fetch "https://www.lemonde.fr"

. Fetching a batch of url from existing CSV file:
    $ minet fetch url -i file.csv > report.csv

. Piping to minet extract:
    $ minet fetch url -i file.csv -c | minet extract -i -

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xan select url file.csv | minet fetch url -i - > report.csv

. Downloading files in specific output directory:
    $ minet fetch url -i file.csv -O html > report.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet fetch "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet fetch column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet fetch "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

# Minet Extract Command

Use multiple processes to extract the main textual content and various
metadata item from large batches of HTML files easily and efficiently.

Extraction of main content is performed using the `trafilatura` library
by Adrien Barbaresi.

Please note that this kind of main content extraction is heavily geared
towards press articles and might not be suited to other kinds of web pages.

More information about the library can be found here:
https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura

Note that this command has been geared towards working in tandem with
the fetch command. This means the command expects, by default, CSV files
containing columns like "path", "http_status", "encoding" etc. that
you can find in a fetch command CSV report.

This said, you can of course feed this command any kind of CSV data,
and use dedicated flags such as --status-column, --body-column to
to inform the command about your specific table.

The command is also able to work on glob patterns, such as: "downloaded/**/*.html",
and can also be fed CSV columns containing HTML content directly if
required.

Positional Arguments:
  path_or_path_column           Single path to process or name of the CSV column
                                containing paths when using -i/--input. Defaults

                                resolve if given.
  -I, --input-dir INPUT_DIR     Directory where the HTML files are stored. Will
                                default to fetch default output directory.

                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress

Columns being added to the output:

. "original_index": index of the line in the original file (the output will be
    arbitrarily ordered since multiple requests are performed concurrently).
. "resolved_url": final resolved url (after solving redirects).
. "http_status": HTTP status code of the request, e.g. 200, 404, 503 etc.
. "resolution_error": an error code if anything went wrong when performing the request.
. "redirect_count": total number of redirections to reach the final url.
. "redirect_chain": list of redirection types separated by "|".

Examples:

. Resolving a batch of url from existing CSV file:
    $ minet resolve url_column -i file.csv > report.csv

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xan select url_column file.csv | minet resolve url_column - > report.csv

. Resolving a single url:
    $ minet resolve https://lemonde.fr

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet fetch "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet fetch column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet fetch "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

# Minet Scrape Command

Use multiple processes to scrape data from a batch of HTML files using
minet scraping DSL documented here:
https://github.com/medialab/minet/blob/master/docs/cookbook/scraping_dsl.md
or a python function given using the -m/--module flag, or a simple inline
python expression given using the -e/--eval flag, or an already implemented
typical scraping routine (listed below).

It will output the scraped items as a CSV or NDJSON file.

Note that this command has been geared towards working in tandem with
the fetch command. This means the command expects, by default, CSV files
containing columns like "path", "http_status", "encoding" etc. that
you can find in a fetch command CSV report.

This said, you can of course feed this command any kind of CSV data,
and use dedicated flags such as --status-column, --body-column to
to inform the command about your specific table.

The command is also able to work on glob patterns, such as: "downloaded/**/*.html",
and can also be fed CSV columns containing HTML content directly if
required.

Note that a scraper can be "singular", i.e. emitting a single item per scraped
HTML file, or "plural" if it can emit 0 or n items per file.

Know that, for convenience, "singular" scraper will always emit a line
per line in your input, contrary to "plural" ones. This means that sometimes
said lines will be empty because the scraper did not match anything or if
an error occurred.

Positional Arguments:
  scraper                       Path to a scraper definition file, or name of a
                                builtin scraper, e.g. "title" (see the complete
                                list below), or a path to a python module and
                                function (e.g. scraper.py,
                                scraper.py:scrape_title).
  path_or_path_column           Single path to process or name of the CSV column
                                containing paths when using -i/--input. Defaults

                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite

                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file (potentially gzipped) containing all
                                the paths you want to process. Will consider `-`
                                as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be

                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.

Builtin scrapers:

. "canonical": scrape the <link rel="canonical"> tag href if any.
. "metas": scrape the <meta> tags if any.
. "rss": scrape the RSS feed urls if any.
. "title": scrape the <title> tag if any.
. "urls": scrape all the relevant <a> tag href urls. Will join them

    with the correct base url if --url-column is valid.
. "europresse": scrape the articles from europresse HTML files.

Examples:

. Scraping a single file on disk:
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml ./path/to/file.html

. Scraping a `minet fetch` report:
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml -i report.csv -I downloaded > scraped.csv

. Scraping a single url:
    $ minet fetch "https://lemonde.fr" | minet scrape scraper.yml -i -

. Using a builtin scraper:
    $ minet scrape title -i report.csv > titles.csv

. Using the `scrape` (default) function of target python module:
    $ minet scrape -m scraper.py -i report.csv > titles.csv

. Using the `scrape_title` function of target python module:
    $ minet scrape -m scraper.py:scrape_title -i report.csv > titles.csv

. Using an inline python expression to evaluate:
    $ minet scrape -e 'soup.scrape_one("title")' -i report.csv > titles.csv

. Indicating a custom path column (e.g. "file"):
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml file -i report.csv -I downloaded > scraped.csv

. Scraping a CSV column containing HTML directly:
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml -i report.csv --body-column html > scraped.csv

. Scraping a bunch of files using a glob pattern:
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml "./content/**/*.html" --glob > scraped.csv

. Scraping using a CSV file containing glob patterns:
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml pattern -i patterns.csv --glob > scraped.csv

. Working on a fetch report from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ minet fetch url file.csv | minet scrape scraper.yml -i - -I downloaded > scraped.csv

. Yielding items as newline-delimited JSON (jsonl):
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml -i report.csv --format jsonl > scraped.jsonl

. Using a strainer to optimize performance:
    $ minet scrape links-scraper.yml --strain "a" -i report.csv > links.csv

. Keeping only some columns from input CSV file:
    $ minet scrape scraper.yml -i report.csv -s name,url > scraped.csv

# Minet Screenshot Command

Use multithreaded browser emulation to screenshot batches of urls
from a CSV file. The command outputs a CSV report with additional
metadata about the HTTP calls and the produced screenshots on disk.

Positional Arguments:
  url_or_url_column             Single url to process or name of the CSV column
                                containing urls when using -i/--input.

Options:
  --adblock                     Whether to use the ublock-origin browser
                                extension.
  --automatic-consent           Whether to use the "I still don't care about
                                cookies" browser extension to try and get rid of
                                GDPR/cookies consent forms when screenshotting.
  --domain-parallelism DOMAIN_PARALLELISM
                                Max number of urls per domain to hit at the same
                                time. Defaults to `1`.
  -f, --filename-column FILENAME_COLUMN
                                Name of the column used to build retrieved file
                                names. Defaults to a md5 hash of final url. If
                                the provided file names have no extension (e.g.
                                ".jpg", ".pdf", etc.) the correct extension will
                                be added depending on the file type.
  --filename-template FILENAME_TEMPLATE
                                A template for the name of the fetched files.
  --folder-strategy FOLDER_STRATEGY
                                Name of the strategy to be used to dispatch the
                                retrieved files into folders to alleviate issues
                                on some filesystems when a folder contains too
                                much files. Note that this will be applied on
                                top of --filename-template. All of the
                                strategies are described at the end of this
                                help. Defaults to `flat`.
  --full-page                   Whether to create full page screenshots.
  --height HEIGHT               Page height in pixels. Defaults to `1080`.
  -O, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR   Directory where the screenshots will be written.
                                Defaults to `screenshots`.
  -t, --threads THREADS         Number of threads to use. Will default to a
                                conservative number, based on the number of
                                available cores. Feel free to increase.
  --throttle THROTTLE           Time to wait - in seconds - between 2 calls to
                                the same domain. Defaults to `0.2`.
  --timeout TIMEOUT             Maximum time - in seconds - to spend for each
                                request before triggering a timeout. Defaults to
                                ~30s.
  --url-template URL_TEMPLATE   A template for the urls to fetch. Handy e.g. if
                                you need to build urls from ids etc.
  --wait WAIT                   Time to wait, in seconds, before taking the
                                screenshot. This might be a good idea if none of
                                the --wait-until strategies work for you and if
                                you need to give more time to the browser
                                extensions to kick in. This obviously makes the
                                whole process slower.
  --wait-until {commit,domcontentloaded,load,networkidle}
                                What to wait to consider the web page loaded.
                                Defaults to `load`.
  --width WIDTH                 Page width in pixels. Defaults to `1920`.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.

Columns being added to the output:

. "original_index": index of the line in the original file (the output will be
    arbitrarily ordered since multiple requests are performed concurrently).
. "http_status": HTTP status code of the request, e.g. 200, 404, 503 etc.
. "screenshot_error": an error code if anything went wrong when performing the request.
. "path": path to the downloaded file, relative to the folder given
    through -O/--output-dir.

--folder-strategy options:

{FolderStrategy.DOCUMENTATION}

Examples:

. Screenshot a batch of url from existing CSV file:
    $ minet screenshot url_column -i file.csv > report.csv

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xan select url_column file.csv | minet screenshot url_column - > report.csv

. Screenshot a single url:
    $ minet screenshot https://lemonde.fr

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet fetch "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet fetch column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet fetch "value1,value2" --explode ","

Columns being added to the output:

. "canonicalized_url": url cleaned up but technically the same.
. "normalized_url": url aggressively normalized by removing any part
  that is not useful to determine which resource it is actually
  pointing at.
. "fingerprinted_url": url even more aggressively normalized. Might
  not be valid anymore, but useful for statistical aggregation.
. "inferred_redirection": redirection directly inferred from the
  url without needing to make any HTTP request.
. "domain_name": public suffix-aware domain name of the url.
. "hostname": full hostname of the url.
. "normalized_hostname": normalized hostname, i.e. stripped of "www",
  "m" or some language subdomains etc., of the url.
. "fingerprinted_hostname": hostname even more aggressively normalized.
  Might not be valid anymore.

how to use the command with a CSV file?

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet url-parse "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet url-parse column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet url-parse column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet url-parse column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet url-parse "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Minet Facebook Post Command

Scrape Facebook post.

This requires to be logged in to a Facebook account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

You must set your account language to English (US) for the
command to work.

Note that, by default, Facebook will translate post text
when they are not written in a language whitelisted here:
https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=language

In this case, minet will output both the original text and
the translated one. But be aware that original text may be
truncated, so you might want to edit your Facebook settings
using the url above to make sure text won't be translated
for posts you are interested in.

Of course, the CLI will warn you when translated text is
found so you can choose to edit your settings early as
as possible.

Finally, some post text is always truncated on Facebook
when displayed in lists. This text is not yet entirely
scraped by minet at this time.

Positional Arguments:
  post_url_or_post_url_column   Single post url to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing post urls when using

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Reproducing a crawl:
    $ minet hyphe crawl corpus.csv

Notes regarding sqlite storage temporary files:

If you spawn a persistent crawler, some of its state will be kept using
specialized sqlite databases on disk.

Be aware that sqlite sometimes need to perform cleanup operations that rely
on temporary files that will be written in a folder configured as the
`SQLITE_TMPDIR` env variable. Be sure to set this variable when running this
command, especially when the crawler files will be stored on a different disk
and if writing in the host's `/tmp` directory can be risky due to insufficient
storage available.

Example:

. Searching comments from the post https://www.instagram.com/p/CpA46rmU26Y/:
    $ minet instagram comments https://www.instagram.com/p/CpA46rmU26Y/ > comments.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet instagram comments "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet instagram comments column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet instagram comments column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet instagram comments column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet instagram comments "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

# Instagram User Following Command

Scrape Instagram accounts followed with a given username, user url or user id.

This requires to be logged in to an Instagram account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

Beware, instagram only provides temporary links, not permalinks,
for profile picture urls retrieved as the "profile_pic_url" in
the result. Be sure to download them fast if you need them (you can
use the `minet fetch` command for that, and won't need to use cookies).

If a username is a number without '@' at the beginning, it will be
considered as an id.

Positional Arguments:
  user_or_user_column           Single username, user url or user id to process
                                or name of the CSV column containing usernames,
                                user urls or user ids when using -i/--input.

Options:
  -c, --cookie COOKIE           Authenticated cookie to use or browser from
                                which to extract it (supports "firefox",

                                Defaults to `firefox`. Can also be configured in
                                a .minetrc file as "instagram.cookie" or read
                                from the MINET_INSTAGRAM_COOKIE env variable.
  -l, --limit LIMIT             Maximum number of accounts to retrieve per user.

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet mediacloud medias "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet mediacloud medias column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet mediacloud medias column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet mediacloud medias column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet mediacloud medias "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

    $ minet telegram channel-messages "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet telegram channel-messages column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet telegram channel-messages column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet telegram channel-messages "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Tiktok Search Videos Command

Scrape Tiktok videos with given keyword(s).

This requires to be logged in to an Tiktok account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

Challenges are hashtags, that can be associated with a description.

The url have a limited life time (indicated by a timestamp in the
url). If you want to get the resources associated to it, you should
use the `minet fetch` command.

This command allows you to get about 450 results, ordered by user
relevance (a mix of most popular, and most relevant according to your
profile).

# Minet Twitter Attrition Command

Using Twitter API to find whether batches of tweets are still
available today and if they aren't, attempt to find a reason why.

This command relies on tweet ids or tweet urls. We recommend to add `--user` and
the tweet's user id to the command if you can, as more information can
be obtained when the user id (or the full url) is known.

The same can be said about retweet information and the `--retweeted-id` flag.

The command will output a report similar to the input file and
containing an additional column named "current_tweet_status" that can take
the following values:

    - "available_tweet": tweet is still available.
    - "user_or_tweet_deleted": tweet was deleted or its author was deactivated. To know whether it is one or the other reason
                                for unavailability that is the right one, add --user to the command.
    - "suspended_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is suspended.
    - "deactivated_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is deactivated.
    - "deactivated_or_renamed_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is either deactivated or changed its screen name
                                        (only when using tweet urls or tweet ids and screen names instead of user ids).
    - "protected_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is protected.
    - "censored_tweet": tweet is unavailable because it was consored by Twitter.
    - "blocked_by_tweet_author": tweet cannot be found because you were blocked by its author.
    - "unavailable_tweet": tweet is not available, which means it was
                            deleted by its user.
    - "unavailable_retweet": retweet is not available, meaning that the user
                                cancelled their retweet.
    - "unavailable_retweeted_tweet": the retweeted tweet is unavailable,
                                        meaning it was either deleted by its original
                                        user or the original user was deactivated.
    - "censored_retweeted_tweet": the original tweet was censored by Twitter, making the retweet unavailable.
    - "protected_retweeted_user": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a protected user.
    - "suspended_retweeted_user": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a suspended user.
    - "blocked_by_original_tweet_author": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a user who blocked you.

Examples:

. Getting followers of a list of user:
    $ minet tw followers screen_name -i users.csv > followers.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter followers "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter followers column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet twitter followers column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter followers column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet twitter followers "value1,value2" --explode ","

Examples:

. Getting the users who retweeted a list of tweets:
    $ minet tw retweeters tweet_id -i tweets.csv > retweeters.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter retweeters "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter retweeters column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet twitter retweeters column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter retweeters column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet twitter retweeters "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Minet Twitter Scrape Command

Scrape Twitter's public facing search API to collect tweets or users.

Be sure to check Twitter's advanced search to check what kind of
operators you can use to tune your queries (time range, hashtags,
mentions, boolean etc.):
https://twitter.com/search-advanced?f=live

Useful operators include "since" and "until" to search specific
time ranges like so: "since:2014-01-01 until:2017-12-31", or "from" that
let you search all tweets from a given user like so: "from:medialab_ScPo".

Note that since 2023-04-21, Twitter search is not available to
visitors of the website without being logged in. This means that
the scraper now requires some cookies to be able to work. So, by
default, the command will grab the relevant cookies from your
local Firefox browser (be sure to be logged in). But you can also
ask the command to grab the cookie from another browser or provide
the cookie string directly instead. Check the -c/--cookie docs to
figure out how to proceed.

Finally, be advised that since you are actually using your account
to scrape data, there is nothing preventing Twitter from banning your
account and it might very well happen in the future (who knows?).

BEWARE: the web search results seem to become inconsistent when
queries return vast amounts of tweets. In which case you are
strongly advised to segment your queries using temporal filters.

NOTE 2023-07-12: scraping users does not work anymore for now.
Tweet scraping was fixed but He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named breaks things
on a daily basis so be warned this might not be very stable nor
consistent.

Positional Arguments:
  {tweets,users}                What to scrape. Currently only allows for
                                `tweets` or `users`.
  query_or_query_column         Single query to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing queries when using -i/--input.

Options:
  -c, --cookie COOKIE           Authenticated cookie to use or browser from
                                which to extract it (supports "firefox",
                                "chrome", "chromium", "opera" and "edge").
                                Defaults to `firefox`. Can also be configured in
                                a .minetrc file as "twitter.cookie" or read from
                                the MINET_TWITTER_COOKIE env variable.
  -f, --force                   Bypass confirmation.
  --include-refs                Whether to emit referenced tweets (quoted,
                                retweeted & replied) in the CSV output. Note
                                that it consumes a memory proportional to the
                                total number of unique tweets retrieved.
  -l, --limit LIMIT             Maximum number of tweets or users to collect per
                                query.
  --query-template QUERY_TEMPLATE
                                Query template. Can be useful for instance to
                                change a column of twitter user screen names
                                into from:@user queries.
  --timezone TIMEZONE           Timezone for dates, for example 'Europe/Paris'.
                                Defaults to UTC.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file (potentially gzipped) containing all
                                the queries you want to process. Will consider
                                `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.

                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals

  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.

Examples:

. Collecting the latest 500 tweets of a given Twitter user:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets "from:@jack" --limit 500 > tweets.csv

. Collecting the tweets from multiple Twitter queries listed in a CSV file:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets query -i queries.csv > tweets.csv

. Templating the given CSV column to query tweets by users:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets user -i users.csv --query-template 'from:@{value}' > tweets.csv

. Collecting users with "adam" in their user_name or user_description:
    $ minet tw scrape users adam > users.csv

Tips:

- You can add a "OR @aNotExistingHandle" to your query to avoid searching
  for your query terms in usernames or handles. Note that this is a temporary hack
  which might stop working at any time so be sure to double check before relying on
  this trick.

    $ minet tw scrape tweets "keyword OR @anObviouslyNotExistingHandle"

# Minet Twitter Tweets Count Command

Count the number of tweets matching a given query using
Twitter API v2.

The counts can be granularized by day, hour or minute.

The API is also meant to return the total number of tweets
matching the query but this has been found to be unreliable
and inconsistent so you will have to sum the granularized
counts instead.

The current command does not aggregate per month or year
because sometimes the order of counts does not seem
to be reliable either (even if they are found to be complete
in the final output).

Note that if you don't have an academic access, this command
will only return counts for the last ~7 days only.

If you have an academic access, don't forget to use the
--academic flag.

Finally note that sometimes, the API returns no data instead
of counts of 0, in which case no lines will be emitted in
the CSV output for the affected query.

API docs for the relevant call:
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/api-reference/get-tweets-counts-recent

API docs for the academic call:
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/api-reference/get-tweets-counts-all

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter tweets "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter tweets column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet twitter tweets column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter tweets column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xan search -s col . | minet twitter user-tweets column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets "value1,value2" --explode ","

# YouTube videos

Retrieve metadata about YouTube videos using the API.

Positional Arguments:
  video_or_video_column         Single video to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing videos when using -i/--input.

Options:
  -k, --key KEY                 YouTube API Data dashboard API key. Can be used
                                more than once. Can also be configured in a
                                .minetrc file as "youtube.key" or read from the
                                MINET_YOUTUBE_KEY env variable.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file (potentially gzipped) containing all
                                the videos you want to process. Will consider
                                `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --rcfile RCFILE               Custom path to a minet configuration file. More
                                info about this here:
                                https://github.com/medialab/minet/blob/master/do
                                cs/cli.md#minetrc
  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.
