# Minet Cookbook

`minet` is a CLI (**C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterface) tool tailored to perform typical [web mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_mining) tasks easily.

Being written in `python`, `minet` can also be used as a library to help you perform the same tasks from the comfort of your own scripts.

But learning a new tool is never an easy thing and this is why this cookbook tries to collect a variery of use-case-oriented guides designed to help you figure out how to use the tool to achieve your own goals.
