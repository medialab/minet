<h2 id="help-flag">-h/--help</h2>

If you need help about a command, don't hesitate to use the `-h/--help` flag or the `help` command:

```
minet ct posts -h
# or:
minet ct posts --help
# or
minet help ct posts
```

<h2 id="version-flag"></h2>

To check the installed version of `minet`, you can use the `--version` flag:

```
minet --version
>>> minet x.x.x
```

<h2 id="minetrc">minetrc config files</h2>

Minet supports configuration files so you can skip some tedious command line arguments that you would need to provide each time you call `minet` otherwise (such as `--token` for crowdtangle commands).

Those configuration files can be written in YAML or JSON and can either be passed to minet using the `--rcfile` argument or will be searched at the following paths (with this precedence):

- `./.minetrc{,.yml,.yaml,.json}`
- `~/.minetrc{,.yml,.yaml,.json}`

_Configuration file_

```yml
---
buzzsumo:
  token: "MY_BZ_TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet bz` commands
crowdtangle:
  token: "MY_CT_TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet ct` commands
  rate_limit: 10 # Used as --rate-limit for `minet ct` commands
facebook:
  cookie: "MY_FACEBOOK_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet fb` commands
instagram:
  cookie: "MY_INSTAGRAM_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet insta` commands
mediacloud:
  token: "MY_MC_TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet mc` commands
tiktok:
  cookie: "MY_TIKTOK_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet tk` commands
twitter:
  api_key: "MY_API_KEY" # Used as --api-key for `minet tw` commands
  api_secret_key: "MY_API_SECRET_KEY" # Used as --api-secret-key for `minet tw` commands
  access_token: "MY_ACCESS_TOKEN" # Used as --access-token for `minet tw` commands
  access_token_secret: "MY_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" # Used as --access-token-secret for `minet tw` commands
youtube:
  key: "MY_YT_API_KEY" # Used as --key for `minet yt` commands
```

<h2 id="envvars">minet environment variables</h2>

Alternatively you can also set some arguments using environment variables whose name starts with `MINET_` and followed by the proper key.

To build the name of the variable, first check what can be configured in a minet [rcfile](#minetrc) and build your variable name by joining its path using an underscore:

For instance, to override `facebook.cookie`, the variable will be `MINET_FACEBOOK_COOKIE`.

If one of the path's key already contains underscore, it will work all the same. So to override `twitter.api_key`, the variable will be `MINET_TWITTER_API_KEY`.

Note that the given variable will be cast to the proper type as if it was passed as a command line argument (for instance, `MINET_CROWDTANGLE_RATE_LIMIT` will correctly be cast as an integer).

Finally note that command line arguments and flags will take precedence over environment variables, and that environment variables will take precedence over any rcfile configuration, but you can of course mix and match.

## cookies

```
Usage: minet cookies [-h] [--silent] [--csv] [--url URL] [-o OUTPUT]
                     {chrome,chromium,edge,firefox,opera}

HTTP calls and will generally write the retrieved files in a folder
given by the user.

Positional Arguments:
  value_or_column_name          Single url to process or name of the CSV column
                                containing urls when using -i/--input.

  -c, --contents-in-report, -w, --no-contents-in-report
                                Whether to include retrieved contents, e.g.
                                html, directly in the report and avoid writing
                                them in a separate folder. This requires to
                                standardize encoding and won't work on binary
                                formats. Note that --contents-in-report is the
                                default when no input file is given.
  --domain-parallelism DOMAIN_PARALLELISM
                                Max number of urls per domain to hit at the same

                                names. Defaults to a md5 hash of final url. If
                                the provided file names have no extension (e.g.
                                ".jpg", ".pdf", etc.) the correct extension will
                                be added depending on the file type.
  --filename-template FILENAME_TEMPLATE
                                A template for the name of the fetched files.
  --folder-strategy FOLDER_STRATEGY
                                Name of the strategy to be used to dispatch the
                                retrieved files into folders to alleviate issues
                                on some filesystems when a folder contains too
                                much files. Note that this will be applied on
                                top of --filename-template. Defaults to "flat".
                                All of the strategies are described at the end
                                of this help.

                                computer's browser (supports "firefox",
                                "chrome", "chromium", "opera" and "edge").
  -H, --header HEADERS          Custom headers used with every requests.
  --insecure                    Whether to allow ssl errors when performing
                                requests or not.

                                Maximum number of redirections to follow before
                                breaking. Defaults to 5.
  --only-html                   Only download pages whose url looks like it
                                could be HTML (e.g. a url without extension or
                                ending in .html, .php etc.). Or, said
                                differently, don't download pages whose url
                                clearly indicate you won't get HTML (e.g. a url
                                ending in .pdf or .json url).
  -O, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR   Directory where the fetched files will be
                                written. Defaults to "downloaded".
  -X, --request METHOD          The http method to use. Will default to GET.

                                you need to build urls from ids etc.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`).
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file containing all the urls you want to
                                process. Will consider `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --resume                      Whether to resume from an aborted collection.
                                Need -o to be set.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

columns being added to the output:

. "index": index of the line in the original file (the output will be
    arbitrarily ordered since multiple requests are performed concurrently).
. "resolved": final resolved url (after solving redirects) if different
    from starting url.
. "status": HTTP status code of the request, e.g. 200, 404, 503 etc.
. "error": an error code if anything went wrong when performing the request.
. "filename": path to the downloaded file, relative to the folder given
    through -O/--output-dir.
. "mimetype": detected mimetype of the requested file.
. "encoding": detected encoding of the requested file if relevant.
. "body": if -c/--contents-in-report is set, will contain the
    downloaded text and the files won't be written to disk.

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m." or "fr.", for instance).

examples:

. Fetching a batch of url from existing CSV file:
    $ minet fetch url_column file.csv > report.csv

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xsv select url_column file.csv | minet fetch url_column -i i > report.csv

. Fetching a single url, useful to pipe into `minet scrape`:
    $ minet fetch http://google.com | minet scrape ./scrape.json - > scraped.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet cmd "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a csv file:
    $ minet cmd column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet cmd column_name -i -
```

## extract

```

                     report_or_glob_pattern

# Minet Extract Command

Use multiple processes to extract raw content and various metadata
from a batch of HTML files. This command can either work on a
`minet fetch` report or on a bunch of files. It will output an
augmented report with the extracted text.

Extraction is performed using the `trafilatura` library by Adrien
Barbaresi. More information about the library can be found here:
https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura

Note that this methodology mainly targets news article and may fail
to extract relevant content from other kind of web pages.

Positional Arguments:
  report_or_glob_pattern        Report CSV file from `minet fetch` or glob
                                pattern if used with --glob. Will understand `-`
                                as stdin.

Optional Arguments:
  -g, --glob GLOB               Whether to extract text from a bunch of html
                                files on disk matched by a glob pattern rather
                                than sourcing them from a CSV report.
  -I, --input-dir INPUT_DIR     Directory where the HTML files are stored.
                                Defaults to "downloaded" if --glob is not set.
  -p, --processes PROCESSES     Number of processes to use. Defaults to roughly

  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`).
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

columns being added to the output:

. "extract_error": any error that happened when extracting content.
. "canonical_url": canonical url of target html, extracted from

    $ minet resolve url_column file.csv > report.csv

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xsv select url_column file.csv | minet resolve url_column - > report.csv

. Resolving a single url:
    $ minet resolve https://lemonde.fr

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet cmd "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a csv file:
    $ minet cmd column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet cmd column_name -i -

# Minet Facebook Post Command

Scrape Facebook post.

This requires to be logged in to a Facebook account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

You must set your account language to English (US) for the
command to work.

Note that, by default, Facebook will translate post text
when they are not written in a language whitelisted here:
https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=language

In this case, minet will output both the original text and
the translated one. But be aware that original text may be
truncated, so you might want to edit your Facebook settings
using the url above to make sure text won't be translated
for posts you are interested in.

Of course, the CLI will warn you when translated text is
found so you can choose to edit your settings early as
as possible.

Finally, some post text is always truncated on Facebook
when displayed in lists. This text is not yet entirely
scraped by minet at this time.

Positional Arguments:
  value_or_column_name        Single post url to process or name of the CSV
                              column containing post urls when using -i/--input.

rough estimation of the real engagement metric: "Share 45K" for example.

Note that this number does not actually only correspond to the number of
likes or shares, but it is rather the sum of like, love, ahah, angry, etc.

# Instagram User Followers Command

Scrape Instagram followers with a given username, user url or user id.
On verified accounts, you may be unable to get all of them.

This requires to be logged in to an Instagram account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

Beware, instagram only provides temporary links, not permalinks,
for profile picture urls retrieved as the "profile_pic_url" in
the result. Be sure to download them fast if you need them (you can
use the `minet fetch` command for that, and won't need to use cookies).

If a username is a number without '@' at the begining, it will be
considered as an id.

Positional Arguments:
  value_or_column_name        Single username, user url or user id to process or
                              name of the CSV column containing usernames, user
                              urls or user ids when using -i/--input.

                              "firefox". Can also be configured in a .minetrc
                              file as "instagram.cookie" or read from the
                              MINET_INSTAGRAM_COOKIE env variable.

# Minet Twitter Attrition Command

Using Twitter API to find whether batches of tweets are still
available today and if they aren't, attempt to find a reason why.

This command relies on tweet ids or tweet urls. We recommand to add `--user` and
the tweet's user id to the command if you can, as more information can
be obtained when the user id (or the full url) is known.

The same can be said about retweet information and the `--retweeted-id` flag.

The command will output a report similar to the input file and
containing an additional column named "current_tweet_status" that can take
the following values:

    - "available_tweet": tweet is still available.
    - "user_or_tweet_deleted": tweet was deleted or its author was deactivated. To know whether it is one or the other reason
                                for unavailability that is the right one, add --user to the command.
    - "suspended_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is suspended.
    - "deactivated_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is deactivated.
    - "deactivated_or_renamed_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is either deactivated or changed its screen name
                                        (only when using tweet urls or tweet ids and screen names instead of user ids).
    - "protected_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is protected.
    - "censored_tweet": tweet is unavailable because it was consored by Twitter.
    - "blocked_by_tweet_author": tweet cannot be found because you were blocked by its author.
    - "unavailable_tweet": tweet is not available, which means it was
                            deleted by its user.
    - "unavailable_retweet": retweet is not available, meaning that the user
                                cancelled their retweet.
    - "unavailable_retweeted_tweet": the retweeted tweet is unavailable,
                                        meaning it was either deleted by its original
                                        user or the original user was deactivated.
    - "censored_retweeted_tweet": the original tweet was censored by Twitter, making the retweet unavailable.
    - "protected_retweeted_user": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a protected user.
    - "suspended_retweeted_user": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a suspended user.
    - "blocked_by_original_tweet_author": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a user who blocked you.

# Minet Twitter Scrape Command

Scrape Twitter's public facing search API to collect tweets or users.

Be sure to check Twitter's advanced search to check what kind of
operators you can use to tune your queries (time range, hashtags,
mentions, boolean etc.):
https://twitter.com/search-advanced?f=live

Useful operators include "since" and "until" to search specific
time ranges like so: "since:2014-01-01 until:2017-12-31".

BEWARE: the web search results seem to become inconsistent when
queries return vast amounts of tweets. In which case you are
strongly advised to segment your queries using temporal filters.

Positional Arguments:
  {tweets,users}                What to scrape. Currently only allows for
                                `tweets` or `users`.
  value_or_column_name          Single query to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing queries when using -i/--input.

Optional Arguments:
  --include-refs                Whether to emit referenced tweets (quoted,
                                retweeted & replied) in the CSV output. Note
                                that it consumes a memory proportional to the
                                total number of unique tweets retrieved.
  -l, --limit LIMIT             Maximum number of tweets or users to collect per
                                query.
  --query-template QUERY_TEMPLATE
                                Query template. Can be useful for instance to
                                change a column of twitter user screen names
                                into from:@user queries.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`).
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file containing all the queries you want to
                                process. Will consider `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

examples:

. Collecting the latest 500 tweets of a given Twitter user:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets "from:@jack" --limit 500 > tweets.csv

. Collecting the tweets from multiple Twitter queries listed in a CSV file:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets query -i queries.csv > tweets.csv

. Templating the given CSV column to query tweets by users:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets user -i users.csv --query-template 'from:@{value}' > tweets.csv

. Tip: You can add a "OR @aNotExistingHandle" to your query to avoid searching
  for your query terms in usernames or handles.
  Note that this is a temporary hack which might stop working at any time so be
  sure to double check before relying on this trick.

# Minet Twitter Tweets Count Command

Count the number of tweets matching the given query using Twitter's
latest API v2. The count's granularity can be at the level of tweets
per day, per hour, or per minute.

This will only return result for the last 8 days only, unless
you have Academic Research access in which case you
can use the --academic flag to retrieve the full count.

Be advised that, for now, results are returned unordered
by Twitter's API if you choose a time granularity for the
results.

Positional Arguments:
  value_or_column_name          Single query to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing queries when using -i/--input.
