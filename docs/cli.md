<h2 id="help-flag">-h/--help</h2>

If you need help about a command, don't hesitate to use the `-h/--help` flag or the `help` command:

```
minet ct posts -h
# or:
minet ct posts --help
# or
minet help ct posts
```

<h2 id="version-flag"></h2>

To check the installed version of `minet`, you can use the `--version` flag:

```
minet --version
>>> minet x.x.x
```

<h2 id="minetrc">minetrc config files</h2>

Minet supports configuration files so you can skip some tedious command line arguments that you would need to provide each time you call `minet` otherwise (such as `--token` for crowdtangle commands).

Those configuration files can be written in YAML or JSON and can either be passed to minet using the `--rcfile` argument or will be searched at the following paths (with this precedence):

- `./.minetrc{,.yml,.yaml,.json}`
- `~/.minetrc{,.yml,.yaml,.json}`

_Configuration file_

```yml
---
buzzsumo:
  token: "MY_BZ_TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet bz` commands
crowdtangle:
  token: "MY_CT_TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet ct` commands
  rate_limit: 10 # Used as --rate-limit for `minet ct` commands
facebook:
  cookie: "MY_FACEBOOK_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet fb` commands
instagram:
  cookie: "MY_INSTAGRAM_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet insta` commands
mediacloud:
  token: "MY_MC_TOKEN" # Used as --token for `minet mc` commands
tiktok:
  cookie: "MY_TIKTOK_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet tk` commands
twitter:
  cookie: "MY_TWITTER_COOKIE" # Used as --cookie for `minet tw scrape` command
  api_key: "MY_API_KEY" # Used as --api-key for `minet tw` commands
  api_secret_key: "MY_API_SECRET_KEY" # Used as --api-secret-key for `minet tw` commands
  access_token: "MY_ACCESS_TOKEN" # Used as --access-token for `minet tw` commands
  access_token_secret: "MY_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" # Used as --access-token-secret for `minet tw` commands
youtube:
  key: "MY_YT_API_KEY" # Used as --key for `minet yt` commands
```

<h2 id="envvars">minet environment variables</h2>

Alternatively you can also set some arguments using environment variables whose name starts with `MINET_` and followed by the proper key.

To build the name of the variable, first check what can be configured in a minet [rcfile](#minetrc) and build your variable name by joining its path using an underscore:

For instance, to override `facebook.cookie`, the variable will be `MINET_FACEBOOK_COOKIE`.

If one of the path's key already contains underscore, it will work all the same. So to override `twitter.api_key`, the variable will be `MINET_TWITTER_API_KEY`.

Note that the given variable will be cast to the proper type as if it was passed as a command line argument (for instance, `MINET_CROWDTANGLE_RATE_LIMIT` will correctly be cast as an integer).

Finally note that command line arguments and flags will take precedence over environment variables, and that environment variables will take precedence over any rcfile configuration, but you can of course mix and match.

## cookies

```
Usage: minet cookies [-h] [--silent] [--refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND]
                     [--simple-progress] [--csv] [--url URL] [-o OUTPUT]
                     {brave,chrome,chromium,edge,firefox,opera,opera_gx,safari,vivaldi}

# Minet Cookies Command

                                Name of the browser from which to grab cookies.

Optional Arguments:
  --csv                         Whether to format the output as CSV. If --url is
                                set, will output the cookie's morsels as CSV.
  --url URL                     If given, only returns full cookie header value
                                for this url.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be

  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

Examples:

. Dumping cookie jar from firefox:
    $ minet cookies firefox > jar.txt

                                much files. Note that this will be applied on
                                top of --filename-template. All of the
                                strategies are described at the end of this

                                disk.
  --stateful-redirects          Whether to keep a cookie jar while redirecting
                                and allowing self redirections that track state.
  -t, --threads THREADS         Number of threads to use. You can use `0` if you

                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress

  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Using the most basic crawler following HTML links:
    $ minet crawl url -i urls.csv --max-depth 1

. Crawling using the `process` function from the `crawl` module:
    $ minet crawl -m crawl:process -O crawl-data

Notes regarding sqlite storage temporary files:

If you spawn a persistent crawler, some of its state will be kept using
specialized sqlite databases on disk.

Be aware that sqlite sometimes need to perform cleanup operations that rely
on temporary files that will be written in a folder configured as the
`SQLITE_TMPDIR` env variable. Be sure to set this variable when running this
command, especially when the crawler files will be stored on a different disk
and if writing in the host's `/tmp` directory can be risky due to insufficient
storage available.

# Minet Focus Crawl Command

Minet crawl feature with the possibility
to use regular expressions to filter content.

Regex are not case sensitive, but
accents sensitive.

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Running a simple crawler:
    $ minet focus-crawl url -i urls.csv --content-filter '(?:assembl[ée]e nationale|s[ée]nat)' -O ./result

Notes regarding sqlite storage temporary files:

If you spawn a persistent crawler, some of its state will be kept using
specialized sqlite databases on disk.

Be aware that sqlite sometimes need to perform cleanup operations that rely
on temporary files that will be written in a folder configured as the
`SQLITE_TMPDIR` env variable. Be sure to set this variable when running this
command, especially when the crawler files will be stored on a different disk
and if writing in the host's `/tmp` directory can be risky due to insufficient
storage available.

# Minet Fetch Command

Use multiple threads to fetch batches of urls from a CSV file. The
command outputs a CSV report with additional metadata about the
HTTP calls and will generally write the retrieved files in a folder
given by the user.

Positional Arguments:
  url_or_url_column             Single url to process or name of the CSV column
                                containing urls when using -i/--input.

  --compress-transfer           Whether to send a "Accept-Encoding" header
                                asking for a compressed response. Usually better
                                for bandwidth but at the cost of more CPU work.
  -c, --contents-in-report, -w, --no-contents-in-report
                                Whether to include retrieved contents, e.g.
                                html, directly in the report and avoid writing
                                them in a separate folder. This requires to
                                standardize encoding and won't work on binary
                                formats. Note that --contents-in-report is the
                                default when no input file is given.

                                the provided file names have no extension (e.g.
                                ".jpg", ".pdf", etc.) the correct extension will
                                be added depending on the file type.

                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --resume                      "Whether to resume from an aborted collection.

  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

Columns being added to the output:

. "original_index": index of the line in the original file (the output will be
    arbitrarily ordered since multiple requests are performed concurrently).
. "resolved_url": final resolved url (after templating & solving redirects).
. "http_status": HTTP status code of the request, e.g. 200, 404, 503 etc.
. "datetime_utc": datetime when the response was finished.
. "fetch_error": an error code if anything went wrong when performing the request.
. "path": path to the downloaded file, relative to the folder given
    through -O/--output-dir.
. "mimetype": detected mimetype of the requested file.
. "encoding": detected encoding of the requested file if relevant.
. "body_size": size of the downloaded document in bytes.
. "body": if -c/--contents-in-report is set, will contain the
    downloaded text and the files won't be written to disk.

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Fetching a single url (can be useful when piping):
    $ minet fetch "https://www.lemonde.fr"

. Fetching a batch of url from existing CSV file:
    $ minet fetch url -i file.csv > report.csv

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xsv select url file.csv | minet fetch url -i - > report.csv

. Downloading files in specific output directory:
    $ minet fetch url -i file.csv -O html > report.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet fetch "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet fetch column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet fetch "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

# Minet Extract Command

Use multiple processes to extract the main textual content and various
metadata item from large batches of HTML files easily and efficiently.

Extraction of main content is performed using the `trafilatura` library
by Adrien Barbaresi.

Please note that this kind of main content extraction is heavily geared
towards press articles and might not be suited to other kinds of web pages.

More information about the library can be found here:
https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura

Note that this command has been geared towards working in tandem with
the fetch command. This means the command expects, by default, CSV files
containing columns like "filename", "http_status", "encoding" etc. as
you can find in a fetch command CSV report.

This said, you can of course feed this command any kind of CSV data,
and use dedicated flags such as --status-column, --body-column to
to inform the command about your specific table.

The command is also able to work on glob patterns, such as: "downloaded/**/*.html",
and can also be fed CSV columns containing HTML content directly if
required.

Positional Arguments:
  filename_or_filename_column   Single filename to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing filenames when using
                                -i/--input. Defaults to "filename".

  --encoding ENCODING           Name of the default encoding to use. If not
                                given the command will infer it for you.
  --encoding-column ENCODING_COLUMN
                                Name of the CSV column containing file encoding.
                                Defaults to `encoding`.
  --error-column ERROR_COLUMN   Name of the CSV column containing a fetch error.
                                Defaults to `fetch_error`.
  -g, --glob                    Will interpret given filename as glob patterns
                                to resolve if given.
  -I, --input-dir INPUT_DIR     Directory where the HTML files are stored.

. "http_status": HTTP status code of the request, e.g. 200, 404, 503 etc.
. "resolution_error": an error code if anything went wrong when performing the request.
. "redirect_count": total number of redirections to reach the final url.
. "redirect_chain": list of redirection types separated by "|".

Examples:

. Resolving a batch of url from existing CSV file:
    $ minet resolve url_column file.csv > report.csv

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xsv select url_column file.csv | minet resolve url_column - > report.csv

. Resolving a single url:
    $ minet resolve https://lemonde.fr

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet fetch "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet fetch column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet fetch "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

# Minet Scrape Command

Use multiple processes to scrape data from a batch of HTML files using
minet scraping DSL documented here:
https://github.com/medialab/minet/blob/master/docs/cookbook/scraping_dsl.md

It will output the scraped items as a CSV or NDJSON file.

Note that this command has been geared towards working in tandem with
the fetch command. This means the command expects, by default, CSV files
containing columns like "filename", "http_status", "encoding" etc. as
you can find in a fetch command CSV report.

This said, you can of course feed this command any kind of CSV data,
and use dedicated flags such as --status-column, --body-column to
to inform the command about your specific table.

The command is also able to work on glob patterns, such as: "downloaded/**/*.html",
and can also be fed CSV columns containing HTML content directly if
required.

Columns being added to the output:

. "original_index": index of the line in the original file (the output will be
    arbitrarily ordered since multiple requests are performed concurrently).
. "http_status": HTTP status code of the request, e.g. 200, 404, 503 etc.
. "screenshot_error": an error code if anything went wrong when performing the request.
. "path": path to the downloaded file, relative to the folder given
    through -O/--output-dir.

--folder-strategy options:

{FolderStrategy.DOCUMENTATION}

Examples:

. Screenshot a batch of url from existing CSV file:
    $ minet screenshot url_column file.csv > report.csv

. CSV input from stdin (mind the `-`):
    $ xsv select url_column file.csv | minet screenshot url_column - > report.csv

. Screenshot a single url:
    $ minet screenshot https://lemonde.fr

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will

> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet fetch "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet fetch column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet fetch column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet fetch "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Minet Url Join Command

Join two CSV files by matching them on columns containing urls. It
works by indexing the first file's urls in a specialized
URL trie to match them with the second file's urls.

Positional Arguments:
  column1                       Name of the column containing urls in the
                                indexed file.
  input1                        Path to the file to index. Will understand `-`
                                as stdin.
  column2                       Name of the column containing urls in the second
                                file.
  input2                        Path to the second file. Will understand `-` as
                                stdin.

Optional Arguments:
  -p, --match-column-prefix MATCH_COLUMN_PREFIX
                                Optional prefix to add to the first file's
                                column names to avoid conflicts. Defaults to ``.

  url without needing to make any HTTP request.
. "domain_name": public suffix-aware domain name of the url.
. "hostname": full hostname of the url.
. "normalized_hostname": normalized hostname, i.e. stripped of "www",
  "m" or some language subdomains etc., of the url.

  Might not be valid anymore.
. "probably_shortened": whether the url is probably shortened or
  not (bit.ly, t.co etc.).
. "probably_typo": whether the url probably contains typo or not
  (such as inclusive language in french : curieux.se etc.).
. "probably_homepage": whether the given url looks like a website's
  homepage.
. "should_resolve": whether the given url looks like something
  we should resolve, i.e. shortened url or DOI etc.
. "could_be_html": whether the given url could lead to a HTML file.

. Parsing Facebook urls:
    $ minet url-parse url -i fbposts.csv --facebook > report.csv

. Parsing YouTube urls:
    $ minet url-parse url -i ytvideos.csv --youtube > report.csv

. Parsing Twitter urls:
    $ minet url-parse url -i tweets.csv --twitter > report.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet url-parse "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet url-parse column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet url-parse column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet url-parse column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet url-parse "value1,value2" --explode ","

    $ minet bz domain-summary 'nytimes.com' --begin-date 2019-01-01 --end-date 2019-03-01 --token YOUR_TOKEN

. Returning the number of articles and pages found in BuzzSumo for a list of domain names in a CSV:
    $ minet bz domain-summary domain_name domain_names.csv --begin-date 2020-01-01 --end-date 2021-06-15 --token YOUR_TOKEN  > domain_name_summary.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet buzzsumo domain-summary "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet buzzsumo domain-summary column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet buzzsumo domain-summary column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet buzzsumo domain-summary column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet buzzsumo domain-summary "value1,value2" --explode ","

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet buzzsumo exact-url "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet buzzsumo exact-url column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet buzzsumo exact-url column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet buzzsumo exact-url column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet buzzsumo exact-url "value1,value2" --explode ","

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet crowdtangle posts-by-id "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet crowdtangle posts-by-id column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet crowdtangle posts-by-id column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet crowdtangle posts-by-id column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet crowdtangle posts-by-id "value1,value2" --explode ","

Examples:

. Computing a summary of aggregated stats for urls contained in a CSV row:
    $ minet ct summary url urls.csv --token YOUR_TOKEN --start-date 2019-01-01 > summary.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet crowdtangle summary "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet crowdtangle summary column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet crowdtangle summary column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet crowdtangle summary column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet crowdtangle summary "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Minet Facebook Comments Command

Scrape a Facebook post's comments.

This requires to be logged in to a Facebook account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

Positional Arguments:
  post_url_or_post_url_column   Single post url to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing post urls when using
                                -i/--input.

Optional Arguments:
  -c, --cookie COOKIE           Authenticated cookie to use or browser from
                                which to extract it (supports "firefox",
                                "chrome", "chromium", "opera" and "edge").
                                Defaults to `firefox`. Can also be configured in
                                a .minetrc file as "facebook.cookie" or read
                                from the MINET_FACEBOOK_COOKIE env variable.
  --throttle THROTTLE           Throttling time, in seconds, to wait between
                                each request. Defaults to `2.0`.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file (potentially gzipped) containing all
                                the post urls you want to process. Will consider
                                `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --rcfile RCFILE               Custom path to a minet configuration file. More

  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.

Examples:

. Scraping a post's comments:
    $ minet fb comments https://www.facebook.com/groups/186982532676569/permalink/4096995827030341/ > comments.csv

. Grabbing cookies from chrome:
    $ minet fb comments -c chrome https://www.facebook.com/groups/186982532676569/permalink/4096995827030341/ > comments.csv

. Scraping comments from multiple posts listed in a CSV file:
    $ minet fb comments post_url -i posts.csv > comments.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet facebook comments "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet facebook comments column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet facebook comments column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet facebook comments column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet facebook comments "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Minet Facebook Post Command

Scrape Facebook post.

This requires to be logged in to a Facebook account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

You must set your account language to English (US) for the
command to work.

Note that, by default, Facebook will translate post text
when they are not written in a language whitelisted here:
https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=language

In this case, minet will output both the original text and
the translated one. But be aware that original text may be
truncated, so you might want to edit your Facebook settings
using the url above to make sure text won't be translated
for posts you are interested in.

Of course, the CLI will warn you when translated text is
found so you can choose to edit your settings early as
as possible.

Finally, some post text is always truncated on Facebook
when displayed in lists. This text is not yet entirely
scraped by minet at this time.

Positional Arguments:
  post_url_or_post_url_column   Single post url to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing post urls when using

Examples:

. Fetching authors of a series of posts in a CSV file:
    $ minet fb post-authors post_url -i fb-posts.csv > authors.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet facebook post-authors "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet facebook post-authors column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet facebook post-authors column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet facebook post-authors column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet facebook post-authors "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Minet Facebook Url Likes Command

Retrieve the approximate number of "likes" (actually an aggregated engagement metric)
that a url got on Facebook. The command can also be used with a list of urls stored in a CSV file.
This number is found by scraping Facebook's share button, which only gives a
rough estimation of the real engagement metric: "Share 45K" for example.

Note that this number does not actually only correspond to the number of
likes or shares, but it is rather the sum of like, love, ahah, angry, etc.
reactions plus the number of comments and shares that the URL got on Facebook

--folder-strategy options:

. "flat": default choice, all files will be written in the indicated
    content folder.

. "fullpath": all files will be written in a folder consisting of the
    url hostname and then its path.

. "prefix-x": e.g. "prefix-4", files will be written in folders
    having a name that is the first x characters of the file's name.
    This is an efficient way to partition content into folders containing
    roughly the same number of files if the file names are random (which
    is the case by default since md5 hashes will be used).

. "hostname": files will be written in folders based on their url's
    full host name.

. "normalized-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some undesirable parts (such as
    "www.", or "m.", for instance).

. "fingerprinted-hostname": files will be written in folders based on
    their url's hostname stripped of some more undesirable parts (such as
    "fr.", for instance) and their public suffix will be dropped.

Examples:

. Reproducing a crawl:
    $ minet hyphe crawl corpus.csv

Notes regarding sqlite storage temporary files:

If you spawn a persistent crawler, some of its state will be kept using
specialized sqlite databases on disk.

Be aware that sqlite sometimes need to perform cleanup operations that rely
on temporary files that will be written in a folder configured as the
`SQLITE_TMPDIR` env variable. Be sure to set this variable when running this
command, especially when the crawler files will be stored on a different disk
and if writing in the host's `/tmp` directory can be risky due to insufficient
storage available.

# Instagram Comments Command

Scrape Instagram comments with a given post url, post shortcode or post id.

This requires to be logged in to an Instagram account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

Positional Arguments:
  post_or_post_column           Single post url, post shortcode or post id to
                                process or name of the CSV column containing
                                post urls, post shortcodes or post ids when
                                using -i/--input.

Optional Arguments:
  -c, --cookie COOKIE           Authenticated cookie to use or browser from
                                which to extract it (supports "firefox",

                                Defaults to `firefox`. Can also be configured in
                                a .minetrc file as "instagram.cookie" or read
                                from the MINET_INSTAGRAM_COOKIE env variable.
  -l, --limit LIMIT             Maximum number of comments to retrieve per post.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite

                                want to process. Will consider `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --rcfile RCFILE               Custom path to a minet configuration file. More

. Searching comments from the post https://www.instagram.com/p/CpA46rmU26Y/:
    $ minet instagram comments https://www.instagram.com/p/CpA46rmU26Y/ > comments.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be

> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added
> by the command. You can always restrict the input file
> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet instagram comments "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet instagram comments column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet instagram comments column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet instagram comments column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet instagram comments "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Instagram User Followers Command

Scrape Instagram followers with a given username, user url or user id.
On verified accounts, you may be unable to get all of them.

This requires to be logged in to an Instagram account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

Beware, instagram only provides temporary links, not permalinks,
for profile picture urls retrieved as the "profile_pic_url" in
the result. Be sure to download them fast if you need them (you can
use the `minet fetch` command for that, and won't need to use cookies).

If a username is a number without '@' at the beginning, it will be
considered as an id.

Positional Arguments:
  user_or_user_column           Single username, user url or user id to process
                                or name of the CSV column containing usernames,
                                user urls or user ids when using -i/--input.

Optional Arguments:
  -c, --cookie COOKIE           Authenticated cookie to use or browser from
                                which to extract it (supports "firefox",

                                Defaults to `firefox`. Can also be configured in
                                a .minetrc file as "instagram.cookie" or read
                                from the MINET_INSTAGRAM_COOKIE env variable.
  -l, --limit LIMIT             Maximum number of followers to retrieve per
                                user.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file (potentially gzipped) containing all
                                the usernames, user urls or user ids you want to
                                process. Will consider `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --rcfile RCFILE               Custom path to a minet configuration file. More

                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

example:

. Searching followers with the username banksrepeta:
    $ minet instagram user-followers banksrepeta > banksrepeta_followers.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be
> given a single value to process or a bunch of them if
> given the column of a CSV file passed to -i/--input instead.

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added

> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet instagram user-followers "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet instagram user-followers column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet instagram user-followers column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet instagram user-followers column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet instagram user-followers "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

# Instagram User Posts Command

Scrape Instagram posts with a given username, user url or user id.

This requires to be logged in to an Instagram account, so
by default this command will attempt to grab the relevant
authentication cookies from a local Firefox browser.

If you want to grab cookies from another browser or want
to directly pass the cookie as a string, check out the
-c/--cookie flag.

The urls in the medias_url column have a limited life time.
It is not the case for the url in main_thumbnail_url, which
corresponds to the first image (the video cover if the first
media is a video). Be sure to download them fast if you need
them (you can use the `minet fetch` command for that, and
won't need to use cookies).

If a username is a number without '@' at the beginning, it will be
considered as an id.

Positional Arguments:
  user_or_user_column           Single username, user url or user id to process
                                or name of the CSV column containing usernames,

example:

. Searching posts from the account paramountplus:
    $ minet instagram user-posts paramountplus > paramountplus_posts.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will

> columns to keep by using the -s/--select flag.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet instagram user-posts "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet instagram user-posts column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet instagram user-posts column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet instagram user-posts column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet instagram user-posts "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Minet Twitter Attrition Command

Using Twitter API to find whether batches of tweets are still
available today and if they aren't, attempt to find a reason why.

This command relies on tweet ids or tweet urls. We recommend to add `--user` and
the tweet's user id to the command if you can, as more information can
be obtained when the user id (or the full url) is known.

The same can be said about retweet information and the `--retweeted-id` flag.

The command will output a report similar to the input file and
containing an additional column named "current_tweet_status" that can take
the following values:

    - "available_tweet": tweet is still available.
    - "user_or_tweet_deleted": tweet was deleted or its author was deactivated. To know whether it is one or the other reason
                                for unavailability that is the right one, add --user to the command.
    - "suspended_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is suspended.
    - "deactivated_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is deactivated.
    - "deactivated_or_renamed_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is either deactivated or changed its screen name
                                        (only when using tweet urls or tweet ids and screen names instead of user ids).
    - "protected_user": tweet cannot be found because its user is protected.
    - "censored_tweet": tweet is unavailable because it was consored by Twitter.
    - "blocked_by_tweet_author": tweet cannot be found because you were blocked by its author.
    - "unavailable_tweet": tweet is not available, which means it was
                            deleted by its user.
    - "unavailable_retweet": retweet is not available, meaning that the user
                                cancelled their retweet.
    - "unavailable_retweeted_tweet": the retweeted tweet is unavailable,
                                        meaning it was either deleted by its original
                                        user or the original user was deactivated.
    - "censored_retweeted_tweet": the original tweet was censored by Twitter, making the retweet unavailable.
    - "protected_retweeted_user": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a protected user.
    - "suspended_retweeted_user": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a suspended user.
    - "blocked_by_original_tweet_author": tweet cannot be found because it is a retweet of a user who blocked you.

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter attrition "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter attrition column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet twitter attrition column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter attrition column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet twitter attrition "value1,value2" --explode ","

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter friends "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter friends column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet twitter friends column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter friends column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet twitter friends "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.

Examples:

. Getting the users who retweeted a list of tweets:
    $ minet tw retweeters tweet_id -i tweets.csv > retweeters.csv

how to use the command with a CSV file?

> A lot of minet commands, including this one, can both be

> Note that when given a CSV file as input, minet will
> concatenate the input file columns with the ones added

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter retweeters "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter retweeters column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet twitter retweeters column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter retweeters column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet twitter retweeters "value1,value2" --explode ","
```

# Minet Twitter Scrape Command

Scrape Twitter's public facing search API to collect tweets or users.

Be sure to check Twitter's advanced search to check what kind of
operators you can use to tune your queries (time range, hashtags,
mentions, boolean etc.):
https://twitter.com/search-advanced?f=live

Useful operators include "since" and "until" to search specific
time ranges like so: "since:2014-01-01 until:2017-12-31", or "from" that
let you search all tweets from a given user like so: "from:medialab_ScPo".

Note that since 2023-04-21, Twitter search is not available to
visitors of the website without being logged in. This means that
the scraper now requires some cookies to be able to work. So, by
default, the command will grab the relevant cookies from your
local Firefox browser (be sure to be logged in). But you can also
ask the command to grab the cookie from another browser or provide
the cookie string directly instead. Check the -c/--cookie docs to
figure out how to proceed.

Finally, be advised that since you are actually using your account
to scrape data, there is nothing preventing Twitter from banning your
account and it might very well happen in the future (who knows?).

BEWARE: the web search results seem to become inconsistent when
queries return vast amounts of tweets. In which case you are
strongly advised to segment your queries using temporal filters.

NOTE 2023-07-12: scraping users does not work anymore for now.
Tweet scraping was fixed but He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named breaks things
on a daily basis so be warned this might not be very stable nor
consistent.

Positional Arguments:
  {tweets,users}                What to scrape. Currently only allows for
                                `tweets` or `users`.
  query_or_query_column         Single query to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing queries when using -i/--input.

Optional Arguments:
  -c, --cookie COOKIE           Authenticated cookie to use or browser from
                                which to extract it (supports "firefox",
                                "chrome", "chromium", "opera" and "edge").
                                Defaults to `firefox`. Can also be configured in
                                a .minetrc file as "twitter.cookie" or read from
                                the MINET_TWITTER_COOKIE env variable.
  --include-refs                Whether to emit referenced tweets (quoted,
                                retweeted & replied) in the CSV output. Note
                                that it consumes a memory proportional to the
                                total number of unique tweets retrieved.
  -l, --limit LIMIT             Maximum number of tweets or users to collect per
                                query.
  --query-template QUERY_TEMPLATE
                                Query template. Can be useful for instance to
                                change a column of twitter user screen names
                                into from:@user queries.
  --timezone TIMEZONE           Timezone for dates, for example 'Europe/Paris'.
                                Defaults to UTC.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file (potentially gzipped) containing all
                                the queries you want to process. Will consider
                                `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --rcfile RCFILE               Custom path to a minet configuration file. More

  --refresh-per-second REFRESH_PER_SECOND
                                Number of times to refresh the progress bar per
                                second. Can be a float e.g. `0.5` meaning once
                                every two seconds. Use this to limit CPU usage
                                when launching multiple commands at once.
                                Defaults to `10`.
  --simple-progress             Whether to simplify the progress bar and make it
                                fit on a single line. Can be useful in terminals
                                with partial ANSI support, e.g. a Jupyter
                                notebook cell.
  --silent                      Whether to suppress all the log and progress
                                bars. Can be useful when piping.
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit

Examples:

. Collecting the latest 500 tweets of a given Twitter user:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets "from:@jack" --limit 500 > tweets.csv

. Collecting the tweets from multiple Twitter queries listed in a CSV file:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets query -i queries.csv > tweets.csv

. Templating the given CSV column to query tweets by users:
    $ minet tw scrape tweets user -i users.csv --query-template 'from:@{value}' > tweets.csv

. Collecting users with "adam" in their user_name or user_description:
    $ minet tw scrape users adam > users.csv

Tips:

- You can add a "OR @aNotExistingHandle" to your query to avoid searching
  for your query terms in usernames or handles. Note that this is a temporary hack
  which might stop working at any time so be sure to double check before relying on
  this trick.

    $ minet tw scrape tweets "keyword OR @anObviouslyNotExistingHandle"

Examples:

. Searching tweets using "cancer" as a query:
    $ minet tw tweet-search cancer > tweets.csv

. Running multiple queries in series:
    $ minet tw tweet-search query -i queries.csv > tweets.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet twitter tweet-search column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple

# Minet Twitter Tweets Count Command

Count the number of tweets matching a given query using
Twitter API v2.

The counts can be granularized by day, hour or minute.

The API is also meant to return the total number of tweets
matching the query but this has been found to be unreliable
and inconsistent so you will have to sum the granularized
counts instead.

The current command does not aggregate per month or year
because sometimes the order of counts does not seem
to be reliable either (even if they are found to be complete
in the final output).

Note that if you don't have an academic access, this command
will only return counts for the last ~7 days only.

If you have an academic access, don't forget to use the
--academic flag.

Finally note that sometimes, the API returns no data instead
of counts of 0, in which case no lines will be emitted in
the CSV output for the affected query.

API docs for the relevant call:
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/counts/api-reference/get-tweets-counts-recent

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet twitter user-tweets column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet twitter user-tweets "value1,value2" --explode ","

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet youtube channel-videos "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet youtube channel-videos column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet youtube channel-videos column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet youtube channel-videos column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet youtube channel-videos "value1,value2" --explode ","

. Here is how to use a command with a single value:
    $ minet youtube search "value"

. Here is how to use a command with a CSV file:
    $ minet youtube search column_name -i file.csv

. Here is how to read CSV file from stdin using `-`:
    $ xsv search -s col . | minet youtube search column_name -i -

. Here is how to indicate that the CSV column may contain multiple
  values separated by a special character:
    $ minet youtube search column_name -i file.csv --explode "|"

. This also works with single values:
    $ minet youtube search "value1,value2" --explode ","

# Youtube videos

Retrieve metadata about Youtube videos using the API.

Positional Arguments:
  video_or_video_column         Single video to process or name of the CSV
                                column containing videos when using -i/--input.

Optional Arguments:
  -k, --key KEY                 YouTube API Data dashboard API key. Can be used
                                more than once. Can also be configured in a
                                .minetrc file as "youtube.key" or read from the
                                MINET_YOUTUBE_KEY env variable.
  -s, --select SELECT           Columns of -i/--input CSV file to include in the
                                output (separated by `,`). Use an empty string
                                if you don't want to keep anything: --select ''.
  --explode EXPLODE             Use to indicate the character used to separate
                                multiple values in a single CSV cell. Defaults
                                to none, i.e. CSV cells having a single values,
                                which is usually the case.
  --total TOTAL                 Total number of items to process. Might be
                                necessary when you want to display a finite
                                progress indicator for large files given as
                                input to the command.
  -i, --input INPUT             CSV file (potentially gzipped) containing all
                                the videos you want to process. Will consider
                                `-` as stdin.
  -o, --output OUTPUT           Path to the output file. Will consider `-` as
                                stdout. If not given, results will also be
                                printed to stdout.
  --rcfile RCFILE               Custom path to a minet configuration file. More
