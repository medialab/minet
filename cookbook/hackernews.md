# Scraping and Crawling Hacker News

In this tutorial, you will learn multiple ways `minet` can be leveraged to scrape & crawl the famous [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to apply a `minet` scraper declaration, fetch multiple pages and design a fully-fledged, resumable and fault-tolerant crawler that can scrape the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) thoroughly.

## Summary

## Designing our scraper

To enable its users to quickly write scrapers and to apply them using a command line tool, `minet` uses its own declarative language that can be written in JSON or YAML.

A full description of this language can be found on [this](./scraping_dsl.md) other cookbook document, but since Hacker News cannot be describe as a complicated website, you should be able to understand what our scraper does without needing to read this document yet.
